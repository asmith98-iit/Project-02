		<h1>Computer Simulations</h1>
		
		<p>
			Computer Simulations allow for complex ideas snd algorithms to be computed infinitley faster than if done by hand.

			Computer Simulations help with both research and devlopment in almost all STEM fields and could be applied to almost all jobs.
			A relevant example of this is desease spreading simulations, which are simulations that model the spread of deseases given an infectivity, population density, recovery rate, etc.

			A very prominant use of this would be in the field of Astrophysics.
			To model complex interactions of planets and stars, you need extremely high detail physics simulations of gravity along with any other forces involved.

			Another example could be simulating traffic flow and modeling grid lock, which could help cities avoid costly traffic issues.

			All images generated were done so on Alexander Smith's personal computer via a rendering software called visions of chaos
